# DEPLOYHELP LLC Multi-Agent Orchestration

- **Objective**: Coordinate a purpose-built team of autonomous agents to plan,
  design, build, and continuously improve DEPLOYHELP LLC's website and online
  presence.
- **Scope**: Strategic positioning, UX/UI, copywriting, SEO, analytics,
  marketing funnels, automation, and go-to-market enablement.
- **Cadence**: Daily async collaboration, weekly sprint planning, monthly
  strategic review.

## 1. Orchestration Architecture

- **Orchestrator Agent ("Mission Control")**
  - Owns the master backlog, sprint planning, and triage of external requests.
  - Spins up focused sub-conversations, assigns owners, sets deadlines.
  - Enforces workflow: intake -> situational awareness -> option space ->
    decision -> execution -> verification -> publish/report.
  - Maintains the audit log, progress dashboard, and success metrics for
    leadership.

- **Communication Protocol**
  - Shared channel `#deployhelp-mission` for decisions, retrospectives, and
    blocker escalations.
  - Thread-per-initiative (for example `website-refresh-q4`, `seo-updates`,
    `ads-experiments`).
  - Structured message template: `[Context] [Goal] [Analysis/Artifacts]
    [Decision] [Next Steps]`.
  - Every update references URLs, repo paths, owners, and current metrics.

- **Knowledge Base and Memory**
  - `docs/` folder stores long-lived artifacts (brand book, ICPs, tone guide,
    SEO handbook).
  - `backlog/` contains machine-readable tickets (YAML with status, priority,
    dependencies).
  - Weekly sync summaries live under `reports/week-XX.md`.

## 3. Operating Playbook

- **Daily Standup (async)**
  - Mission Control posts at 09:00: yesterday's progress, today's focus,
    blockers, KPIs.
  - Each agent replies with RAG (Red/Amber/Green) status and next actions.

- **Work Item Lifecycle**
  1. **Intake**: Mission Control converts the request into a structured ticket
     (`backlog/<yyyy-mm-dd>-slug.yaml`).
  2. **Discovery**: Assigned lead runs a situational scan (metrics, competitor
     snippets, tech constraints).
  3. **Co-Design**: Relevant agents collaborate on options with pros and cons.
  4. **Decision Gate**: Mission Control or Business Strategist approves a
     direction.
  5. **Execution**: Implementation agents deliver artifacts/PRs referencing
     precise repo paths.
  6. **Review and QA**: Peer agent validates (SEO checks content, engineer checks
     analytics instrumentation, etc.).
  7. **Publish**: Mission Control updates the change log, metrics baseline, and
     closes the ticket.

- **Weekly Sprint Planning**
  - Review metrics trend, backlog burn-down, and capacity.
  - Select 2-3 focus epics, map dependencies, assign owners.

- **Monthly Strategy Review**
  - Business Strategist leads: assess pipeline impact, customer insight,
    upcoming bets.
  - Update positioning doc, go-to-market roadmap, experimentation matrix.

  ```

## 5. Initial Backlog Seeds

- Launch discovery for a full website redesign (audit site, analytics, persona
  interviews).
- Produce messaging architecture: headline, subhead, proof points per ICP.
- Build a 12-week content calendar across blog, LinkedIn, newsletter.
- Implement analytics instrumentation audit (GA4, Tag Manager, conversion
  events).
- Draft the SEO technical checklist (site speed, structured data, sitemap,
  robots).
- Design a lead magnet funnel (downloadable asset + email nurturing).

## 6. Tooling and Integration Hooks

- **Repo Structure**
  - `docs/` - strategies, research, design specs.
  - `agents/` - YAML definitions for each agent (persona, prompts,
    responsibilities).
  - `backlog/` - machine-readable work items.
  - `reports/` - weekly and monthly summaries.

- **Automation Targets**
  - GitHub Actions: run lint/tests on website PRs, post results back to chat.
  - Analytics API (GA4, Search Console) ingestion script for weekly spotlight.
  - Social scheduling integration (for example Buffer API) for Social Manager.

## 7. Next Implementation Steps

- Encode agent definitions under `agents/` with prompts, tooling, and hand-off
  expectations.
- Create starter backlog tickets for highest leverage initiatives.
- Set up the reporting skeleton (`reports/week-01.md`) with KPI placeholders.
- Prepare an orchestrator script (Python or TypeScript) to route messages
  between agents for future automation.
